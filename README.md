## Fashion MNIST Classification  
### Objective  
Classify images of clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset using two approaches:  
1. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
2. A fully connected dense neural network.  

### Key Features  
- Comparison of performance between a CNN and a dense network.  
- Visualization of training curves and misclassified images.
